PC homework 1


When I first came into contact with programming and coding, I didn't know much about many basic operations. I haven't figured out how to save my sketch in p5 yet. When I was trying to copy the code, the numbers on the left side were always copied together with the code. In addition, I don't know if some systems are incompatible. Once I start editing the code in p5, I can't open the “file”, "edit" or "sketch" buttons above. I use chrome browser on MacBook pro.
